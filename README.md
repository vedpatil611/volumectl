# volumectl

<p>Easy volume control with alsa. Currently volume is increased/decrease by 5%. Later I will add command line args to specify by how much to increase or decrease the volume.

Use ``` volumectl up ``` to increase volume by 5%.

Use ```volumectl down``` to decrease volume by 5%.

# Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/vedpatil611/volumectl
cd volumectl
sudo make install
```
